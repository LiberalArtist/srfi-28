<H1>Abstract</H1>
  This document specifies Format Strings, a method of interpreting a Scheme
string which contains a number of escape sequences that are replaced with
other string data according to the semantics of each sequence.      
<H1>Rationale</H1>
  Many Scheme systems provide access to a function called <tt>format.</tt>
This function takes as arguments a format string, an ordinary Scheme string
containing zero or more escape sequences, followed zero or more Scheme values.
The procedure processes the format string and performs string replacement
on the escape sequences according to the rules for each code.  This SRFI defines
a basic version of <tt>format</tt> which should allow portable code to be
written using the function without much (if any) effort on the part of Scheme
implementors.  
<H1>Specification</H1>
   <b><tt>format</tt></b> <tt><i>format-string [obj ...] -&gt; string</i></tt>
  
<blockquote>   
  <p>Accepts a message template (a Scheme String), and processes it,   replacing
any escape sequences in order with one or more characters,   the characters
themselves dependent on the semantics of the escape   sequence encountered. 
   </p>
  <p>An escape sequence is a two character sequence in the string   where
the first character is a tilde '~'. Each escape code's   meaning is as follows:</p>
    
  <ul>
     <li><tt>~a </tt> The corresponding value is inserted into the      
 string as if printed with <tt>display</tt>.</li>
     <li><tt>~s </tt>The corresponding value is inserted into the       string
 as if printed with <tt>write</tt>.</li>
     <li><tt>~% </tt>A newline is inserted.</li>
     <li><tt>~~ </tt>A tilde '~' is inserted.</li>
	   
  </ul>
    
  <p><tt>~a</tt> and <tt>~s</tt>, when encountered, require a corresponding 
  Scheme value to be present after the format string.  The values provided 
  as operands are used by the escape sequences in order.  It is an error 
 if fewer values are provided than escape sequences that require them.  
 </p>
  <p><tt>~%</tt> and <tt>~~</tt> require no corresponding value.  </p>
</blockquote>
             
<h2>Examples</h2>
  
<pre>(format "Hello, ~a" "World!")<br>; =&gt; "Hello, World!"<br><br>(format "Error, list is too short: ~s~%" '(one "two" 3))<br>; =&gt; "Error, list is too short: (one \"two\" 3))"<br></pre>
                     
<H1>Implementation</H1>
          The implementation below requires SRFI-6 (Basic string ports) and 
    SRFI-23 (Error reporting mechanism).     <br>
      
<pre>(define format<br>  (lambda (format-string . objects)<br>    (let ((buffer (open-output-string)))<br>      (let loop ((format-list (string-&gt;list format-string))<br>                 (objects objects))<br>        (cond ((null? format-list) (get-output-string buffer))<br>              ((char=? (car format-list) #\~)<br>               (if (null? (cdr format-list))<br>                   (error 'format "Incomplete escape sequence")<br>                   (case (cadr format-list)<br>                     ((#\a)<br>                      (if (null? objects)<br>                          (error 'format "No value for escape sequence")<br>                          (begin<br>                            (display (car objects) buffer)<br>                            (loop (cddr format-list) (cdr objects)))))<br>		     ((#\s)<br>                      (if (null? objects)<br>                          (error 'format "No value for escape sequence")<br>                          (begin<br>                            (write (car objects) buffer)<br>                            (loop (cddr format-list) (cdr objects)))))<br>                     ((#\%)<br>                      (display #\newline buffer)<br>                      (loop (cddr format-list) objects))<br>                     ((#\~)<br>                      (display #\~ buffer)<br>                      (loop (cddr format-list) objects))<br>                     (else<br>                      (error 'format "Unrecognized escape sequence")))))<br>              (else (display (car format-list) buffer)                        <br>                    (loop (cdr format-list) objects)))))))<br>    </pre>
